# MemoryMatchGame

This is a simple card based memory game in which you flip over cards, revealing various images on the other side, and attempt to find matching pairs. 

You are scored based on how many tries it takes you to find all of the matches. You lose one point for every pair you turn over that DO NOT match, and you gain ten points for each pair that DOES match!

You can customize the images that will appear on the cards by entering text into the "GIF" box in the top left and clicking the search button.

This project pulls all images as GIFs from the giphy.com search API and DOES NOT filter the results by anything other than the search term entered.

This project was built and is maintained by jonpking using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.
